For this project I'm using React with typescript.

Testing library used are:
Jest + Enzyme

Project is divided into 2 component:
1. Main component App.tsx for call card rendering
2. NavBar component for left navigation bar

Test cases are added for NavBar component inside tests folder.

To run this project use following commands:
1. npm install to download all dependencies.
2. npm start to run the project

use npm test command to run test cases.
use npm run build to build the project.

As there was no property corresponding to sucessful_landing in api response, I'm using successful_launch property for that.
